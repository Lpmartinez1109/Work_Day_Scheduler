# Work_Day_Scheduler_HW

This is a normal, 9 to 5 work day planner. The purpose of this assignment is to create a working planner that would allow the user to input a reminder inside the textarea on the page that will be saved when the user refreshes the page. Also the user will that there is a distinct color pattern for past, current and future events.

The main focus on the assignment was spent on getting the javascript set up. I first looked at how to display the current day and time using the javascript file.
